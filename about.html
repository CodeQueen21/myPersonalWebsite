            <p>Hi, My name is Raelinda and welcome to my Portfolio! I'm 26 and I was born in Baltimore MD. I've always been a creative person. While growing up, I've dabbled around with drawing, writing, and I even wanted to be a voice actress at some point! Upon graduating high school however, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. I thought I wanted to do phsycology but <br> I knew in the long run it wasn't for me as it had no creative nature and it just wasn't a good fit. I eventually discovered web development through Amazon Career Choice 3 years ago and I've been hooked ever since! I love being able to create something people will use! I hope you enjoy discovering some of the projects I've built.</p>
